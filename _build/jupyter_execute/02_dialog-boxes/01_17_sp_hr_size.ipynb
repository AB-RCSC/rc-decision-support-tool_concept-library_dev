    "{{ hr_size_tu }} information is used in this tool to determine 'camera spacing' and the 'number of cameras' required. This is because how far animals can move will ultimately affect whether the data collected from different locations (or observations of different individuals) are independent of one another. \n",

    "This is one aspect of the \"{{ closure_site_tl }}\" (i.e., {{ def_closure_site }}) {{ mod_assumption_tl_abrv }} of many {{ mod_approach_tl_pl }} (e.g., {{ mod_occupancy_tl_abrv_pl }} [{{ rtxt_mackenzie_et_al_2004  }}]).'**Site independence**' is often used interchangeably with 'site closure', however, the concept of 'site independence' also considers {{ spatial_autocorrelation_tl }}, or \"{{ def_spatial_autocorrelation }}.\" To meet these  {{ mod_assumption_tl_abrv }}, its often suggested to space cameras far enough apart that the same individuals or groups of animals are not **influencing data** from multiple sites (e.g., either by being detected or influencing detection at multiple sites, i.e., camera spacing is larger than the species' home range size). However, its not always ideal to space cameras far enough apart to ensure 'site closure' and 'site independence' assumptions are met. For some approaches, such as capture-recapture [CITE], the opposite is true; sites should be sufficiently close to one another such that individuals ARE picked up across more than one location ('dependence' is required). Meeting these assumptions (i.e., 'site independence' and/or 'site dependence' [approach-dependent]) is important to ensure that the model results are valid (avoid biased results and incorrect conclusions).\n",
