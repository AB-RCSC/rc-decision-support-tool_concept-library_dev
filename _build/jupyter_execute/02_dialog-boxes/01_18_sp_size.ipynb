    "Body size affects the detection process ({{ rtxt_obrien_et_al_2011 }}). Species with a larger body size are more likely to be detected; and therefore may require lower sampling effort than smaller species ({{ rtxt_chatterjee_et_al_2021 }}). Larger species moving through the camera’s detection zone are more likely to trigger the camera ({{ rtxt_chatterjee_et_al_2021 }}; {{ rtxt_rowcliffe_et_al_2011 }}; {{ rtxt_hofmeester_et_al_2017 }}); they can also be detected farther away or occur at wider angles ({{ rtxt_rowcliffe_et_al_2011 }}; {{{ rtxt_hofmeester_et_al_2017 }}). Whereas, small mammals are often undetected due to their small size ({{ rtxt_obrien_et_al_2011 }}; {{ rtxt_anile_devillard_2016 }}) and because \"small species which routinely move at fast speeds, such as stoats and weasels, are likely to have especially small detection zones\" ({{ rtxt_glen_et_al_2013 }}).\n",

    "When thinking beyond the camera's FOV, larger species generally also have larger home ranges ({{ rtxt_garland_1983 }}) and daily movement distances, making them more likely to be detected at multiple cameras ({{ rtxt_chatterjee_et_al_2021 }}), therefore there are also implications for which models may be appropriate (due to assumptions of \"site closure\" / \"independent locations\").\n",
