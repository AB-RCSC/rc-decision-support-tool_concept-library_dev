    "### Number of cameras\n",
    "\n",
    "The optimal number of cameras required will be influenced by factors such as landscape heterogeneity, {{ survey_tl }} duration and spatial scale, species rarity and desired level of precision ({{ rtxt_colyn_et_al_2018 }}; {{ rtxt_rovero_et_al_2013 }}). For example, Kays et al. (2020) found that 25–35 cameras were needed for precise estimates of species richness, depending on the spatial scale of the {{ survey_tl }} and landscape diversity. In general, deploying more cameras and/or for longer durations always results in more precise estimates; however, users can consider rotating cameras across multiple sites for shorter durations (if feasible).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Duration - Camera days per camera location\n",
    "\n",
    "For measures of species richness or diversity, it is presumed that a camera is active long enough to detect rare species that may occur at a specific location ({{ rtxt_wearn_gloverkapfer_2017 }}). If this is not the case, the results will indicate that the species was not present when it was (i.e., a \"false negative\"). False negatives may also be problematic for other measures, such as **{{ mod_rai_tl }}** (count data, with or without {{ mod_zero_inflation_tl }} and/or {{ mod_overdispersion_tl }}), even if the model type used can account for {{ imperfect_detection_tl }} explicitly (e.g., combined occurrence/{{ mod_rai_tl }}; {{ mod_n_mixture_tu }}).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Number of cameras vs. Camera days per camera location\n",
    "\n",
    "If a user must choose between more cameras *vs.* fewer cameras with longer {{ survey_tl_pl }}, Chatterjee et al. (2021) suggested that for rare species, the optimal precision can be obtained by increasing the number of sites, whereas for common species, increasing the number of samples is more effective. For measuring species richness, Si et al. (2014) found that rotating cameras to new sites was more efficient than leaving cameras at fewer sites for longer periods. O'Connor et al. (2017) also recommended utilizing more cameras *vs*. increasing study length to increase {{ detection_probability_tl_pl }}. In general, regardless of species and {{ survey_objectives_tl_abrv }}, increasing the number of {{ survey_tl }} locations or the {{ survey_tl }} length improved precision ({{ rtxt_chatterjee_et_al_2021 }}).\n",

    "The x-axis is the order *q* in the Hill number (eqn [23a]), and is illustrated for values of *q* from 0 to 5. The y-axis is the calculated Hill number (the equivalent number of equally abundant species). Each of the four assemblages has exactly 100 species and 500 individuals, but they differ in their relative evenness: (1) completely even assemblage (black solid line): each species is represented by five individuals; (2) slightly uneven assemblage (red dashed line): 50 species each represented by seven individuals and 50 species each represented by three individuals (this structure is denoted as {50 x 7, 50 x 3}); (3) moderately uneven assemblage (green dotted line): {22 x 10, 28 x 5, 40 x 3, 10 x 2}; (4) highly uneven assemblage (blue dash–dot line): {1 x 120, 1 x 80, 1 x 70, 1 x 50, 3 x 20, 3 x 10, 90 x 1}. For *q*=0, the Hill number is species richness, which is equal to 100 for all assemblages. Because Hill numbers represent the equivalent number of equally abundant species, the curve for the perfectly even assemblage (black solid line) does not change as q is increased. Larger values of q place progressively more weight on common species, so the equivalent number of equally abundant species is much lower for the more uneven assemblages than for more even assemblages.\n",
