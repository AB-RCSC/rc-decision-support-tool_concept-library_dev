    "{{ hr_size_tu }} information is used in this tool to determine 'camera spacing' and the 'number of cameras' required. This is because how far animals can move will ultimately affect whether the data collected from different locations (or observations of different individuals) are independent of one another.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is one aspect of the \"{{ closure_site_tl }}\" (i.e., {{ def_closure_site }}) {{ mod_assumption_tl_abrv }} of many {{ mod_approach_tl_pl }} (e.g., {{ mod_occupancy_tl_abrv_pl }} [{{ rtxt_mackenzie_et_al_2004 }}]).'**Site independence**' is often used interchangeably with 'site closure', however, the concept of 'site independence' also considers {{ spatial_autocorrelation_tl }}, or \"{{ def_spatial_autocorrelation }}.\" To meet these {{ mod_assumption_tl_abrv }}, its often suggested to space cameras far enough apart that the same individuals or groups of animals are not **influencing data** from multiple sites (e.g., either by being detected or influencing detection at multiple sites, i.e., camera spacing is larger than the diameter of the species' home range size). However, its not always ideal to space cameras far enough apart to ensure 'site closure' and 'site independence' assumptions are met. For some approaches, such as capture-recapture [CITE], the opposite is true; sites should be sufficiently close to one another such that individuals ARE picked up across more than one location ('dependence' is required). Meeting these assumptions (i.e., 'site independence' and/or 'site dependence' [approach-dependent]) is important to ensure that the model results are valid (avoid biased results and incorrect conclusions).\n",

    "\n",
    "Species with higher dispersal ability (i.e., able to travel further distances) are more likely to be absent during the survey (Wearn & Glover-Kapfer, 2017).\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, home range size \"**has implications for the interpretation of occupancy**. If animals range over a much larger area than a single site, then a) they may conceivably be unavailable for capture during a sampling occasion, and b) the \"occupancy\" of a site is more related to the ranging patterns and habitat preferences of an individual, rather than the coarse-scale distribution of a species\" (Wearn & Glover-Kapfer, 2017).\n",
    "\n",
    "For some approaches, violation of this {{ mod_assumption_tl_abrv }} can result in an **underestimate of {{ detection_probability_tl_pl }}** and, in turn, **over-estimate {{ obj_density_tl }}** (e.g., with spatial recapture models) or result in simply averaging detections over the sampling period (e.g., {{ mod_rem_tu_abrv }} [{{ rtxt_rowcliffe_et_al_2008 }}; {{ rtxt_rowcliffe_et_al_2013 }}], {{ mod_rest_tu_abrv }} [{{ rtxt_nakashima_et_al_2017 }}] models).\n",
