    "Remote {{ cam_location_tl_pl }} (or {{ sample_station_tl_pl }}) and their spatial arrangement are integral components of any study design; these choices will affect the user’s ability to draw inference(s) about the species or question of interest. There are many species-specific characteristics (e.g., body size, behaviour, rarity, etc.) and environmental factors (e.g., vegetation cover, snow depth) that influence the {{ detection_probability_tl_abrv }} and probability of occurrence of a species, as well as the size of the area that should be surveyed (e.g., {{ rtxt_becker_et_al_2022 }}; {{ rtxt_hofmeester_et_al_2019 }}; {{ rtxt_iknayan_et_al_2014 }}; {{ rtxt_steenweg_et_al_2019 }}). When there are multiple {{ target_species_tu }}, a mix of study designs may be valuable ({{ rtxt_iannarilli_et_al_2021 }}; {{ rtxt_vanwilgenburg_et_al_2020 }}).\n",

    "The {{ survey_tl_objectives_abrv }} of the {{ survey_tl }} will determine the most appropriate study design ([Appendix A - Table A2](https://ab-rcsc.github.io/RCSC-WildCAM_Remote-Camera-Survey-Guidelines-and-Metadata-Standards/1_survey-guidelines/1_10.1_AppendixA-Tables.html)). There are five commonly used study designs in camera studies: [simple random](#sampledesign_random), [systematic random](#sampledesign_systematic_random) (grid), [stratified random](#sampledesign_stratified_random), [clustered](#sampledesign_clustered) (including {{ sampledesign_paired_tl }}) and [targeted](#sampledesign_targeted) (or opportunistic) (Wearn & Glover-Kapfer 2017). A [convenience sampling](#sampledesign_convenience) study design is also used when it is impractical to use another design. Sampling design can occur hierarchically, where one approach is used at a larger scale (i.e., to select grids to place cameras within), and another approach is used at a smaller scale (i.e., to select the location within each grid to place the camera). Refer to the following literature for additional recommendations on study design: {{ rtxt_burton_et_al_2015 }}; {{ rtxt_cusack_et_al_2015 }}; {{ rtxt_fisher_burton_2012 }}; {{ rtxt_kolowski_forrester_et_al_2017 }}; {{ rtxt_oconnell_et_al_2011 }}; {{ rtxt_rovero_et_al_2013 }}; {{ rtxt_steenweg_et_al_2015 }}; {{ rtxt_wearn_gloverkapfer_2017 }} and WildCAM’s [\"sampling design & effort section section\"](https://wildcams.ca/library/camera-trapping-papers-directory/) of their resource library (<https://wildcams.ca/library/camera-trapping-papers-directory/>).\n",

A {{ sampledesign_random_tl_nu }} may help reduce biases that arise from selecting {{ cam_location_tl_pl }} deliberately.

    "A disadvantage of using a simple random design is the tendency to see fewer animals (i.e., is less efficient) when animals are [clustered](#sampledesign_clustered) or exhibit habitat preferences, and the possibility of missing rare habitat types. The proportion of different {{ strata_tl }} (e.g., habitat types) sampled should be the same as (or close to) the true proportion in the {{ study_area_tl }}. For example, if the {{ study_area_tl }} consists of 25% young deciduous forest, then 25% of randomly selected sites should be within young deciduous forest, on average.\n",

    "**Systematic random** – {{ cam_location_tl_pl }} are selected using a two-stage approach. Firstly, grids are selected systematically (to occur within a regular pattern) across the {{ study_area_tl }}. The location of the camera within each grid is then selected randomly. This method is similar to the [simple random](#sampledesign_random) design. The same advantages apply in terms of unbiased landscape representation, and the same {{ mod_approach_tl_pl }}can be used. The disadvantage of using a [systematic random](#sampledesign_systematic_random) (or [simple random](#sampledesign_random) design) is that rare habitat types may be missed.\n",

    "**Systematic non-random** design – sets of [clustered](#sampledesign_clustered) cameras can be deployed within a [systematic non-random](#sampledesign_systematic) approach (i.e., \"systematic clustered\" or \"systematic paired\") to assess the effects of disturbance along a gradient, over time, at multiple scales and/or with control (i.e., reference) {{ sample_station_tl_pl }}. **Hierarchical Before-After Dose-Response (BADR)** is one such method that requires cameras to be placed within a systematic non-random approach, where {{ cam_location_tl_pl }} occur along transects or in [clustered](#sampledesign_clustered) arrays ({{ sample_station_tl_pl }}), selected using a nested spatial hierarchy of sampling to control for variability in land-use type and large-scale patterns ({{ rtxt_bayne_et_al_2022 }}). The {{ study_area_tl }} is divided into land-use regions based on land-use type, then into landscape units, which are assessed for environmental variability to determine where {{ sample_station_tl_pl }} should be placed ({{ rtxt_bayne_et_al_2022 }}). The \"Before-After\" component of BADR incorporates the phase of stressors (i.e., proposed or current development) ({{ rtxt_bayne_et_al_2022 }}). The \"Dose-Response\" component of BADR controls for the variable distribution of activity (and the potential impacts) by incorporating control (or reference) {{ sample_station_tl_pl }} and/or by placing cameras in {{ sample_station_tl_pl }} along a gradient of disturbance ({{ rtxt_bayne_et_al_2022 }}).\n",

This design can help ensure that the sample adequately reflects the major or uncommon {{ strata_tl }} of interest and may be an efficient approach when users are limited by accessibility constraints ({{ rtxt_wearn_gloverkapfer_2017 }}). This design can also be used to increase precision if animal densities are known to be highly variable ({{ rtxt_junker_et_al_2021 }}) or when a species is expected to occur in certain habitat types more often ({{ rtxt_gillespie_et_al_2015 }}).

    "**Clustered** design ([Figure 3d](#TOC_surv_guidelines_fig_3)) – multiple cameras are deployed at a {{ sample_station_tl }}. The distance between cameras ({{ cam_spacing_tl }}) will be influenced by the chosen sampling design, the {{ {{ survey_objectives_tu }} }}, the {{ target_species_tu }} and data analysis. A {{ sampledesign_clustered_tl }} can be used within a [systematic](#sampledesign_systematic) or [stratified](#sampledesign_stratified) approach (i.e., systematic clustered design or as a clustered random design) ({{ rtxt_wearn_gloverkapfer_2017 }}). A {{ sampledesign_clustered_tl }} is common when users are interested in individual identification, such as {{ obj_density_tl }} estimation from {{ typeid_marked_tl_abrv }} or [partially marked populations](#typeid_partially_marked) (e.g., [spatially explicit capture-recapture {{ mod_scr_secr_tu_abrv }}; {{ rtxt_borchers_efford_2008 }}; {{ rtxt_efford_2004 }}; {{ rtxt_royle_young_2008 }}] or [spatial mark-resight {{ mod_smr_tu_abrv }}; {{ rtxt_doran_myers_2018 }}]).

It is, however, important to understand that [targeted](#sampledesign_targeted) sampling may impede one’s ability to make inferences beyond the {{ survey_tl }} area. For some {{ survey_tl_objectives_abrv }}, [targeted](#sampledesign_targeted) sampling may be used within another sampling design (e.g., a [stratified random](#sampledesign_stratified_random) sample of game trails and seismic lines; {{ rtxt_keim_et_al_2021}}).\n",

    "**Convenience design** – {{ cam_location_tl_pl }} or {{ sample_station_tl_pl }} are chosen based on logistic considerations (e.g., remoteness, access constraints, costs). When cost is a key consideration, other more rigorous sampling designs (e.g., stratified; {{ rtxt_vanwilgenburg_et_al_2020 }}) that can incorporate cost should be considered first. One should be cautious when generalizing or drawing conclusions from data collected using [convenience sampling](#sampledesign_convenience), given that estimates can be biased if the sample poorly represents the population of interest. The [convenience sampling](#sampledesign_convenience) design can be used where the goal is to {{ survey_tl }} a specific location(s) without the intent to generalize to un-surveyed areas ({{ rtxt_gillespie_et_al_2015 }}; e.g., Kusi et al., 2020) or to {{ survey_tl }} an area following a report of the occurrence of a rare species. Both [randomized](#sampledesign_random) (e.g., {{ rtxt_found_patterson_2020 }}) or [targeted](#sampledesign_targeted) approaches can be used within a [convenience sampling](#sampledesign_convenience) approach, although the user should still be cautious about extrapolating inferences to areas (or habitat types in an [occupancy framework](#mod_occupancy) [{{ rtxt_mackenzie_et_al_2002 }}]) that were not sampled and, therefore, not represented in the data ({{ rtxt_gillespie_et_al_2015 }}).\n",
