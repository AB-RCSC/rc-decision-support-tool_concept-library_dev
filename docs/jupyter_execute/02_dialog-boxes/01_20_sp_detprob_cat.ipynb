    "Before study design choices are made, there is one critical concept to understand in remote camera research, which may impact study design choices at all levels of the data hierarchy. Reliable use of remote cameras to detect wildlife species hinges on the {{ mod_assumption_tl_abrv }} that what is captured on the cameras accurately reflects what is present on the landscape. However, species are often detected \"imperfectly,\" meaning that they are not always detected when they are present (i.e., {{ imperfect_detection_tl }}; e.g., due to cover of vegetation, cryptic nature or small size) ({{ rtxt_mackenzie_et_al_2004 }}). {{ imperfect_detection_tu }} can occur because the camera failed to capture an individual present at the site or because the animal was simply not present during the {{ survey_tl }} period ({{ rtxt_martin_et_al_2005 }}).\n",
    "\n",
    "{{ imperfect_detection_tu }} results in \"false absences\" and may lead to incorrect conclusions from the data. Understanding and correcting for sources of \"false absences\" is often thought of in terms of probabilities. {{ detection_probability_tu_abrv }} is the probability (likelihood) that an individual from the population of interest is included in the count at time or location *i* ({{ rtxt_mackenzie_kendall_2002 }}). {{ detection_probability_tu_abrv }} can be influenced through multiple processes and at multiple scales. Understanding the sources of \"false absences\" and factors that affect {{ detection_probability_tl_pl }} is an essential step when designing a study, deploying cameras and analyzing camera data.\n",

    "The {{ detection_probability_tl_abrv }} of an animal by a camera depends on three **conditional probabilities (Pr) of detection** that may operate alone or potentially in combination ([Figure 1](#TOC_surv_guidelines_fig_1)).\n",

    "{{ detection_probability_tu_abrv }} can be affected by species-specific characteristics, {{ cam_model_tu }} specifications and set-up, and environmental variables ({{ rtxt_hofmeester_et_al_2019 }}). For example, **species-specific characteristics** (individuals or populations), such as body size (e.g., {{ rtxt_obrien_et_al_2011 }}), behaviour (e.g., {{ rtxt_caravaggi_et_al_2020 }}; {{ rtxt_rowcliffe_et_al_2011 }}), and rarity can influence {{ detection_probability_tl_abrv }}, with larger, bolder and more common species generally having higher {{ detection_rate_tl_pl }}. ** {{ cam_model_tu }} specifications and set-up**, such as the {{ settings_trigger_sensitivity_tu }}, {{ cam_height_tu_nu }}, or {{ cam_angle_tl_abrv }} may affect {{ detection_probability_tl_abrv }} in that smaller species might not be detected or identifiable if the {{ settings_trigger_sensitivity_tu }} is low, or the {{ cam_height_tu_nu }} or {{ cam_angle_tl_abrv }} is too high. The {{ cam_direction_tu_nu }} could impact the probability of an animal triggering a camera if it is directed towards an object that impedes the {{ field_of_view_tu }} or image quality (e.g. due to sun glare). **Environmental factors** (e.g., vegetation cover, snow depth) may affect {{ detection_probability_tl_abrv }} and occurrence (e.g., {{ rtxt_becker_et_al_2022 }}; {{ rtxt_hofmeester_et_al_2019 }}; {{ rtxt_iknayan_et_al_2014 }}; {{ rtxt_steenweg_et_al_2019 }}).

    "(A) The true (unknown) species pool of a metacommunity represented at a site comprises species that have been detected there (green bin), those that have not yet been detected at the site but have been detected at other surveyed sites (yellow bin), and those that have not yet been detected at this or any site but occur in the region (white bin). (B) As temporal and spatial replication (i.e., sampling effort) increases, knowledge of the species pool changes for both the site (green bins) and the metacommunity (green + yellow + white bins). When a site is surveyed few times, the relative size of each bin depends on the factors affecting detectability (Figure 1). If there are few sites and few surveys per site, a large portion of the metacommunity may not be detected (white bin of upper left rectangle), either at the site or at other sites. As the number of surveys per site increases (temporal replication) but not the number of sites surveyed (i.e., little spatial replication), the total number of species detected per site increases (green bin in upper right rectangle), mostly as a result of detecting species that are likely to occur at other sites (yellow bin). When the total number of sites surveyed increases (spatial replication) but not the number of surveys (i.e., little temporal replication), the number of species undetected in the region decreases (white bin in lower left rectangle), but the number of species detected per site remains the same (green bin). As both the number of surveys per site and the number of sites surveyed increase, a greater proportion of species in the metacommunity will be known (green + yellow bins in lower right rectangle), either from being directly detected at the site (green bin) or by being detected at other sites (yellow bin).\n",

    ":::{dropdown}\n",
    "1) At the core lie intrinsic characteristics of the species, including whether it is rare or abundant, its physical appearance (or vocal characteristics) and its behaviour. 2) These are modulated by site characteristics, potentially inducing spatial variation in species detectability. For instance, a given species may be more difficult to detect if the vegetation is denser at a site, if local abundance is lower due to the specific habitat type or if individuals are wary because the site experiences greater levels of disturbance than normal. Ambient noise (e.g. a road) can also make difficult aural detection of species at some sites. 3) Species detectability at a given site may also depend on factors that vary temporally. For instance, the species may display seasonal changes in behaviour or even abundance. Behaviour also normally changes with the time of day and weather conditions, and so do visibility (or audibility) conditions. 4) Finally, the detectability of a given species, at a given site and point in time, depends on the detection method used, the skills of the surveyor and the amount of survey effort (e.g. duration of a survey visit). In the diagram, the numbers in brackets indicate how factors that vary in space and time can modulate aspects defining a species ‘baseline’ detectability. This diagram highlights key factors affecting detectability and their interactions but it is not necessarily an exhaustive account. Differences in survey characteristics in space or time will induce spatial or temporal variation in detectability.\n",
